Hi I'm Will, a 5th year CS student at Drexel University. I'm primarily interested in 
lower level software development but I've dabbled in plenty of other areas. 

This page might seem a little sparse, but that's just because I've only just
recently started uploading things here. So as of right now, any programming assignment
or project I've done recently enough of any size that I can feel somewhat proud of, 
I've been archiving them here. 

One thing to know about me is that I don't program in my free time very often, usually
preferring to pursue other hobbies and social events. Don't let that make it seem like
my passion is lacking, however. Any time I'm programming I always devote my highest level
of effort and attention to detail, since I find it quite fun to do so.

If you want to check out a class project I'm particularly proud of, check out the
'image-stitcher' repository! I sunk loads of time into that project for a computational
photography final and ended up being one of the only students to get it fully functioning.
If you have Matlab installed, you can even get it running yourself, but make sure to check
out the readme for operating details.
